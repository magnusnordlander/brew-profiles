# brew-profiles
Brew data from my Espresso machine. I don't know why you'd want it, but I don't see much reason to keep it secret.

Espresso machine controller: [magnusnordlander/silvia-pi](https://github.com/magnusnordlander/silvia-pi)  
Brew profile visualizer: [magnusnordlander/brewfiler](https://github.com/magnusnordlander/brewfiler)

## Breakpoints in the data

* 2020-07-22: Changed the group temperature sensor. New values are not comparable with old.
